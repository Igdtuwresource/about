      <h2>Who Are We?<br><br>With the aim of <b>LEARN & GROW,</b></h2>
      <p>it is a website introduced in August 2022 to help the students in their academics by providing them all study resources at one place thus relieving the hassle of searching here and there for study materials.<br> And with our broader vision, we have helped students with the best of our capability in every manner. And just over the span of 6 months "IGDTUW RESOURCE" has achieved a lot and got positive reviews from the students, thus, making it an absolute candidate for being a Society to help us achieve our motto of "Learn and Grow".
<br><br>IGDTUW RESOURCE will transcend the limitations of being just a mere society and instead rise to become a truly worthy and exceptional organization, leaving an indelible mark on all those who have the privilege of being a part of it.
